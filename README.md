# ðŸ‘€Â Problem

> Create CampusHub, a cutting-edge web platform redefining connectivity and collaboration within educational institutions. This platform aims to supersede conventional communication tools, establishing a singular, integrated space for seamless interaction among students and faculty. The primary objective is to enhance communication dynamics, fostering a distinct boundary between personal and professional spheres for both educators and learners.
